# ✨ JS Quality Activity ✨

Let's practice tidying some messy code.

This code prints a list of names and then checks that exactly two inputs match the expected number.

### 🗺 Instructions

👉 Run `npm start`. You'll see a list of names printed to the console. Notice that the code is currently failing.

👉 Read `/src/index.js`

👉 Together with your partner, tidy the code up until the marker saying "⛔ STOP".

👉 Aim to make the code more readable, clean, and data-driven.

👉 You should also fix the bug somewhere in lines 0-43 which is causing the code to fail.

☑️ When you're finished, the section after the "⛔ STOP" marker should be unaltered. Running `npm start` should list all the names just like before, and then show a "✅ SUCCESS" message.

🙌 Happy coding!
